ExceptionHandling:
this is a process of stoping an exception from stoping a program from runing.

Exception are mostly used when the program is not trusted completely. there may be exception or there may be no exception
Exception are also used when the programmer is 100% sure that there will be a process that will terminate the program
along the line.


Exception are catched by wrapping the whole code in a try block. that is if there is any exception or if any exception occur
and then a catch bloock at the to catch the incoming exception so as to avoid the program from breaking. then the measage 
will be display in the catch block. and it is also possible to inherit Exception from a base class Exception.
